# webR (development version)

# webR 0.1.0

## Breaking changes
 * Rename the properties of `WebROptions` so that they are all in camelCase, consistent with the rest of the webR TypeScript source. We have made the decision to release the above breaking change quickly while there are still a relatively low number of affected users.

## Bug fixes

 * Improve compatibility when running webR under Node (#167 & #171).

 * Fix `chol()` with `pivot=TRUE` by working around a Fortran library issue.
