Once webR has been loaded into a web page, objects can be converted into JavaScript from the R environment. For example, it is possible perform some computation within R and then convert the resulting R object into a JavaScript object for use.

## Converting R objects to JavaScript objects

::: callout-warning
At the moment, not all R objects can be converted to JavaScript objects. Attempting to convert an unsupported R object will throw a JavaScript exception.
:::

Explicitly converting an [`RObject`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md) to JavaScript can be done by invoking the [`RObject.toJs()`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md#tojs) method, which returns a JavaScript representation of the associated R object. In most cases, JavaScript conversion has been implemented by serialising the R object to an [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs).

### Serialising R objects

Invoking [`RObject.toJs()`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md#tojs) on an R object serialises the object to a JavaScript object of type [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs). This type is designed to form a tree structure, supporting an unambiguous JavaScript representation for potentially nested R objects.

Most R objects are serialised to JavaScript objects that contain the following properties,

| Property | Value                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `type`   | A description of the R object's type as a string.                                                                   |
| `names`  | An array of strings corresponding to the R object's `names` attribute, or `null` for no names.                      |
| `values` | An array containing the value(s) associated with the R object. A JavaScript `null` indicates a missing value, `NA`. |

Some R objects, such as lists or environments, contain references to other R objects. Such objects are serialised recursively. Any R objects deeper than the [maximum depth setting](#serialisation-options) will not be serialised and instead included in the `values` array as an [`RObject`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md). By default, R objects are serialised with infinite maximum depth.

An R `NULL` object is serialised to a JavaScript object of type [`WebRDataJsNull`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajsnull). This type does not include the `names` or `values` properties.

::: callout-warning
The structure of serialised R objects may be updated in future versions of webR, expanding to include more R object attributes. As such, compatibility of serialised R objects between versions of webR is not guaranteed.
:::

#### Serialisation options {#serialisation-options}

An `options` argument of type [`ToJsOptions`](api/js/interfaces/RWorker.ToJsOptions.md) can be provided to the [RObject.toJs()](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md#tojs) method for fine-grained control over how objects are serialised.

The following options are available,

| Property | Description                                                                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `depth`  | How deep should nested R objects be serialised? A value of 0 indicates infinite depth. |

#### Example: Serialising an R double atomic vector

``` javascript
const primes = await webR.evalR('c(2,3,5,7,11,13)');
await primes.toJs()
```

    {
      type: 'double'
      names: null
      values: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    }

### Other R object conversion methods

[Subclasses of `RObject`](api/js/modules/RWorker.md#classes) provide additional methods to convert objects into a JavaScript representation. For example, the [`toTypedArray()`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RDouble.md#totypedarray) method can be invoked on atomic vectors, such as an [`RDouble`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RDouble.md), to access a copy of the raw buffer as it exists in WebAssembly memory.

``` javascript
const primes = await webR.evalR('c(2,3,5,7,11,13)')
await primes.toTypedArray()
```

    Float64Array(6) [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, buffer: ArrayBuffer(48), ... ]

::: callout-note
When converting atomic vectors to JavaScript values, missing values of `NA` are represented as values of `null` in the resulting JavaScript representation. This conversion process may have a performance cost for very large vectors.

When using `toTypedArray()`, however, a copy of the raw memory buffer is returned. In this case the raw sentinel values will be preserved in the case of missing values.

## Cached R objects

[`WebR.objs`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#objs) contains named references to long-living R objects in the form of [`RObject`](api/js/modules/RMain.md#robject) proxies. `WebR.objs` is automatically populated at initialisation time, and its properties may be safely accessed once the promise returned by [`WebR.init()`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#init) resolves.

`WebR.objs` contains references to the following R objects,

| Property    | JavaScript Type                                          | R object                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| `null`      | [`RNull`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RNull.html)             | `NULL`                   |
| `true`      | [`RLogical`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RLogical.md)         | `TRUE`                   |
| `false`     | [`RLogical`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RLogical.md)         | `FALSE`                  |
| `na`        | [`RLogical`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RLogical.md)         | Logical `NA`             |
| `globalEnv` | [`REnvironment`](api/js/classes/RWorker.REnvironment.md) | The R global environment |
| `baseEnv`   | [`REnvironment`](api/js/classes/RWorker.REnvironment.md) | The R base environment   |

## Additional R object proxy hooks

The [`RObject`](api/js/modules/RMain.md#robject) proxies are implemented with so-called hooks, for instance a hook that forwards class method invocation to the webR worker thread. The following hooks provide additional R object functionality.

### Executing R functions from JavaScript {#exec-r}

At the moment, R functions cannot be directly converted into JavaScript functions. However, references to R functions can be executed from JavaScript in a limited way. It is possible to return an R function or closure with [`WebR.evalR()`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#evalr) and wrap it as an [`RFunction`](api/js/modules/RMain.md#rfunction) proxy. The R function represented by the proxy can be called by either:

-   Invoking the [`RFunction.exec()`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RFunction.md#exec) method on the `RFunction` object.

-   Using `()`, i.e. the normal JavaScript function call syntax.

In either case, both JavaScript or [`RObject`](api/js/modules/RMain.md#robject) proxies can be passed as arguments to the associated R function. In the case of JavaScript values they are [converted to R objects](convert-r-to-js.qmd) before function execution.

``` javascript
const fn = await webR.evalR('function(x) { 2 * x }');
const result = await fn.exec([1,2,3]);
await result.toArray()
```

    [2, 4, 6]

The result of the R computation is automatically converted back into a JavaScript representation using [`RObject.toJs()`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md#tojs) if the `RFunction` proxy was executed using `()`.

``` javascript
const sin = await webR.evalR('sin');
await sin([1,2,3]);
```

    {
      type: 'double'
      names: null
      values: [0.8414709848078965, 0.9092974268256817, 0.1411200080598672]
    }

### Looping over R vectors

[`RObject`](api/js/modules/RMain.md#robject) proxies are async iterable for objects with a `length` property. As such, R vectors can be looped over using the JavaScript [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) syntax. For example,

``` javascript
const list = await webR.evalR('list(2,4,6,"abc")')
for await (i of list){
  console.log(await i.toArray())
}
```

    [2]
    [4]
    [6]
    ['abc']
