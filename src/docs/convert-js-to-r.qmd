Once webR has been loaded into a web page, new R objects can be created from the JavaScript environment. For example, it is possible to construct an R object using data provided as a JavaScript array, and then perform some computation in R with that data.

## Creating new R objects

New R objects can be created from the main JavaScript thread by using the `new` operator with proxy classes on an initialised instance of the [`WebR`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md) class.

When an R object is instantiated in this way, webR communicates with the worker thread to orchestrate object creation in WebAssembly memory. As such, new R objects can only be created once communication with the worker thread has been established and the promise returned by [`WebR.init()`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#init) has resolved.

Once the object has been created on the worker thread, a promise is returned resolving as a reference to the new R object [in the form of an `RObject`](objects.qmd). In a modern asynchronous JavaScript environment, the `await` and `new` keywords can be combined.

``` javascript
await webR.init();
let d = await new webR.RObject([2, 4, 6]);
await d.toArray();
```

    [2, 4, 6]

Newly created `RObject` references are protected by the [default shelter](objects.qmd#the-default-shelter) unless [otherwise specified](objects.html#working-with-multiple-shelters). It is your responsibility to call the `destroy()` method to release these objects.

Sometimes webR constructs new R objects implicitly behind the scenes. For instance new R objects are constructed automatically when [executing R functions with JavaScript arguments](convert-r-to-js.qmd#exec-r). In this case memory management is in the hands of webR and doesn't need intervention on your part.

::: callout-warning
`RObject` references that have been created from JavaScript objects are subject to R [memory management](objects.qmd#memory-management) and should be destroyed when no longer in use.

### Constructing R objects from JavaScript objects

The [`WebR` proxy classes](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#properties) take a single JavaScript argument in their constructor functions which will be used for the content of the new R object. JavaScript objects that are able to be converted for use as R objects have type [`WebRData`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdata).

The resulting R object type is chosen based on the contents of the JavaScript argument provided. When there is ambiguity, the following conversion rules are used,

| Constructor Argument                                                       | R Type                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `null`                                                                     | Logical `NA`                                                                                               |
| `boolean`                                                                  | Logical atomic vector                                                                                      |
| `number`                                                                   | Double atomic vector                                                                                       |
| `{ re: 1, im: 2 }`                                                         | Complex atomic vector                                                                                      |
| `string`                                                                   | Character atomic vector                                                                                    |
| JavaScript array                                                           | An atomic vector with type based on the above rules and following the coercion rules of R's `c()` function |
| [Object of type `WebRDataJs`](convert-r-to-js.qmd#serialising-r-objects) | An R object type given by the `type` property in the provided object                                       |
| Other JavaScript object                                                    | Reserved for future use                                                                                    |

In the case of R lists provided as an [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs), the above rules are applied recursively to also construct the objects provided within the list.

### Creating an R object with specific type

As an alternative to constructing an [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs) with an explicit `type` property, several class proxies of different type are available on the [`WebR`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md) instance. For example, the [`WebR.RList`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#rlist) class proxy can be used to specifically construct an R list object, rather than an atomic vector, using a JavaScript array of values.

To see how this can be useful, consider the difference in structure between the following two R object construction examples, using the same JavaScript object as the constructor argument,

``` javascript
let foo = await new webR.RObject([123, 'abc']);
await foo.toJs();
```

    { type: 'character', names: null, values: ['123', 'abc'] }

``` javascript
let foo = await new webR.RList([123, 'abc']);
await foo.toJs();
```

    {
      type: 'list',
      names: null,
      values: [
        { type: 'double', names: null, values: [ 123 ] },
        { type: 'character', names: null, values: ['abc'] }
      ]
    }

### Creating objects using `RObject` references

An [`RObject`](api/js/classes/RWorker.RObject.md) can be used as part of R object construction, either on its own, included in a JavaScript array, or as the values in an [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs).

In such cases a new `RObject` instance will be created, but the R object will not be copied as part of construction. The resulting `RObject` will be a reference to the same point in WebAssembly memory as the source object.

This mechanism can be useful for creating new R lists or environments, or when re-constructing partially serialised objects in the form of an [`WebRDataJs`](api/js/modules/RObject.md#webrdatajs).

## Binding objects to an R environment

The `globalEnv` property, one of [webR's cached R objects](convert-r-to-js.qmd#cached-r-objects), can be used to quickly bind JavaScript objects to variables in the global R environment,

``` javascript
await webR.objs.globalEnv.bind('foo', ['x', 'y', 'z'])
await webR.evalR('print(foo)');
```

    [1] "x" "y" "z"

Alternatively, and to avoid adding to the global scope, a new environment can be directly constructed to be used with [`WebR.evalR()`](api/js/classes/WebR.WebR.md#evalr),

``` javascript
let arr = await new webR.RObject([10, 21, 32]);
let env = await new webR.REnvironment({ foo: arr });
await webR.evalR('print(foo)', env);
```

    [1] 10 21 32
