\title{Graphics device for drawing to a HTML canvas element}
\usage{
canvas(
  width = 504,
  height = 504,
  pointsize = 12,
  bg = "transparent",
  capture = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{width}{The width of the device.}

\item{height}{The height of the device.}

\item{pointsize}{The default point size of plotted text.}

\item{bg}{The initial background colour.}

\item{capture}{If \code{TRUE}, store \code{OffscreenCanvas} elements in the cache.}

\item{...}{Additional graphics device arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
A function with no arguments. When called returns an integer vector
of canvas cache IDs for \code{OffscreenCanvas} elements captured by this device.
}
\description{
A graphics device that generates HTML canvas API calls and executes them on
the worker thread using a JavaScript \code{OffscreenCanvas}. Throughout plotting,
and if \code{capture} is \code{FALSE}, JavaScript \code{ImageBitmap} objects are transmitted
to the main webR thread for display.
}
\details{
The resulting webR output messages are of type
\href{./js/interfaces/WebRChan.CanvasMessage.html}{\code{CanvasMessage}}, with
the \href{./js/interfaces/WebRChan.CanvasMessage.html#type}{\code{type}}
property set as \code{'canvas'} and the
\href{./js/interfaces/WebRChan.CanvasMessage.html#data}{\code{data}} property
populated with further details about the event that triggered the message.

When the graphics device creates a new page an output message is emitted with
the \href{./js/interfaces/WebRChan.CanvasMessage.html#data}{\code{data}}
property set to \code{{ event: 'canvasNewPage' }}.

When bitmap image data is sent to the main thread for display, a message is
emitted with the the bitmap additionally included as part of the
\href{./js/interfaces/WebRChan.CanvasMessage.html#data}{\code{data}} property,
\verb{\{ event: 'canvasImage', image: ImageBitmap \}}.

When \code{capture} is \code{TRUE}, the resulting \code{OffscreenCanvas} elements are stored
in the canvas cache. The captured plots are then retrieved by \code{\link[=eval_r]{eval_r()}}.

A 2x scaling is used to improve the bitmap output visual quality. As such,
the width and height of the HTML canvas element should be twice the width and
height of the graphics device.
